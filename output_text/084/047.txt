The relative expression of these myosin types is determined partly by genetics and partly by other biological factors such as activity, innervation and hormones.The typing of motor units has thus gone through many stages and reached a point where it is recognized that muscle fibers contain varying mixtures of several myosin types that can not easily be classified into specific groups of fibers.
