IIi — fibers intermediate between IIa and IIb.Histochemical and Physiological types correspond as follows:
S and Type I, FR and type IIa, FF and type IIb, FI and IIi.Immunohistochemical (a more recent form of fiber typing)Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC)
Myosin Light Chain — alkali (MLC1)
Myosin Light Chain — regulatory (MLC2)The Immunohistochemical types are as follows, with the type IIa, IIb and slow corresponding to IIa, IIb and slow (type I) histochemical types:Table reproduced fromGene characterization of myosinsThere are currently about 15 known different types of MHC genes recognized in muscle, only some of which may be expressed in a single muscle fiber.
