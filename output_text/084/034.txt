== Motor unit types (vertebrate) ==
Motor units are generally categorized based upon the similarities between several factors:

PhysiologicalContraction speed in Isometric contractions
Rate of rise of force
Time to peak of a twitch contraction (response to a single nerve impulse)FF — Fast fatigable — high force, fast contraction speed but fatigue in a few seconds.
