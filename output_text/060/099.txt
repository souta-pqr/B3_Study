In Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, the storm surge surrounded many of the buildings at the United States Naval Academy, resulting in about $116 million in damage (equivalent to $192.1 million in 2023) The Annapolis Maritime Museum suffered severe damage as well, though volunteers moved artifacts to a safer location.
