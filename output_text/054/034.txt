Eustace Chapuys reported:

[The King] so went up into the chamber where the said Lady Anne was looking out of a window to see the bull-baiting which was going on in the courtyard, and suddenly he embraced and kissed her, and showed her a token which the king had sent her for New Yearâ€™s gift, and she being abashed and not knowing who it was thanked him, and so he spoke with her.
