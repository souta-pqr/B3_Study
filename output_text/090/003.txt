Neserkauhor was a son of Djedkare Isesi, who held a number of honorary titles: "revered with the Great God", "hereditary prince", "greatest of five in the temple of Thoth", "one who is privy to the secrets of the god's word", "chief lector priest", "king's son", "eldest beloved king's son of his body", "sole companion", and "scribe of the good book".It is debated whether Neserkauhor had any real profession or if his titles were purely honorary and he simply spent his life at the royal court.
