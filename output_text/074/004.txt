The village was attacked by two platoons of armored cars and a tank company from the 7th Brigade, and a fierce battle lasted from the evening until seven o'clock the next morning.Evidence of a massacre in which 52â€“64 villagers were killed by the IDF comes from several contemporaneous Israeli government sources and Arab oral history.
