Unlike prophets, the Imams cannot compose a new tanzīl, instead they interpret the tanzīl (Quran) and prophetic guidance (Hadith) by reanalyzing them in the context of new circumstances, while retaining the underlying principled spirit, and help guide "spiritual adepts" to the divine truths by disclosing their inner meanings through the spiritual hermeneutics of taʾwīl.
