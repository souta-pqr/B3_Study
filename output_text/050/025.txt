After plotting an assassination against Ali, Mu'awiya, and the arbitrator of their conflict, Ali was successfully assassinated in 661 CE, and the Imāmate passed on to his son Hasan and then later his son Husayn, or according to the Nizari Isma'ili, the Imamate passed to Hasan, who was an Entrusted Imam (Arabic: الإمام المستودع, romanized: al-imām al-mustawdaʿ), and afterward to Husayn who was the Permanent Imam (Arabic: الإمام المستقر, romanized: al-imām al-mustaqar).
