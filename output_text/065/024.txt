Since 1982, the German Foreign Office has been promoting projects related to the colonial era as part of a cultural preservation program.According to Der Spiegel journalists Heinz HÃ¶hne and Hermann Zolling, the premature end of the German colonial empire in 1918 placed West Germany's intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), which was then led by former Abwehr spymaster Reinhard Gehlen, at a considerable advantage in dealing with the newly independent governments of post-colonial Africa.
