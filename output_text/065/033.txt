== Cultural relations ==
Close cultural relations were already established during the colonial period and some German terms have become established in Kiswahili such as shule (school), hela (money) and nusu kaputi (literally: half broken = full anesthesia).There are numerous church, school, university and city partnerships between the two countries, including a partnership between Potsdam and Zanzibar City and one between Hamburg and Dar es Salaam.
