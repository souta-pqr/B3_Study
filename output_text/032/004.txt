== Songs ==
The band has a wide variety of songs and topics, mostly taken from regular village life, such as: Oscar, the ganter, waking up by aeroplanes, tractors and chain saws; gamblers in Les Vagos; gardeners, who change completely in spring; and what happens if you ask Renate O. in Mömbris-Dörnsteinbach for directions to Omersbach.
