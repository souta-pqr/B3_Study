The wilderness is home to the largest population of near threatened spotted owls, which prefer Douglas-fir or white fir stands and can be found in ponderosa pine forests with a well-developed Gambel oak understory.Reptiles such as the Arizona coral snake and Gila monster are rarely present; common snakes include the black-tailed rattlesnake, rock rattlesnake, and Sonora mountain kingsnake.
