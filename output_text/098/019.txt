The gravity of 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
  
 is denoted as 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{B}}
  
 and will be treated as a perturbation to the dynamics of 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
  
 due to the gravity 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{A}}
  
 of body 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
