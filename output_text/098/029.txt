In such a case this surface must be close to the mass 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
, denote  
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  
 as the distance from 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
 to the separating surface.
