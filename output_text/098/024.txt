It is possible to construct the perturbation ratio 
  
    
      
        
          χ
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi _{B}}
  
 for the frame centered on 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
  
 by interchanging 
  
    
      
        A
        ↔
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\leftrightarrow B}
  
.
