In general this region is rather complicated but in the case that one mass dominates the other, say 
  
    
      
        
          m
          
            A
          
        
        â‰ª
        
          m
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle m_{A}\ll m_{B}}
  
, it is possible to approximate the separating surface.
