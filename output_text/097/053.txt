Rather, these words are part of the peroration of William Davy, Serjeant-at-Law for Somerset, who previously had cited a report of a 1569 case, in the reign of Elizabeth I, in which "one Cartwright brought a slave from Russia and would scourge him; for which he was questioned; and it was resolved, that England was too pure an air for a slave to breathe in"; it is not clear that this was said in the Cartwright case.
