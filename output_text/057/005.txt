RNS are produced in animals starting with the reaction of nitric oxide (•NO) with superoxide (O2•−) to form  peroxynitrite (ONOO−):
•NO (nitric oxide) + O2•− (superoxide) → ONOO− (peroxynitrite)Superoxide anion (O2−) is a reactive oxygen species that reacts quickly with nitric oxide (NO) in the vasculature.
