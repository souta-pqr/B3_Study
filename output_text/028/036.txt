The request of the Holy See in 1904 for the resignation of Bishop Pierre-Joseph Geay (1896-1904) was one of the reasons assigned by the French Republic for breaking with the pope and preparing the separation of Church and State.In August 1859 Bishop Casimir-Alexis-Joseph Wicart held a diocesan synod in the Ã©glise S. Michel in Laval.
