Largely a result of the financial crisis of 2007â€“2010, Birmingham joined fellow Russell Group universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Bristol in not offering any clearing places.The university acted as a training camp for the Jamaican athletics team prior to the 2012 London Olympics.A new library was opened for the 2016/17 academic year, and a new sports centre opened in May 2017.
