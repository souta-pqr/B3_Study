However, Community of Christ does accept two portions of the Pearl of Great Price—the Book of Moses and Joseph Smith–Matthew—as scripture:

Chapters 2–8 of the Book of Moses are included within the Book of Genesis in Community of Christ's Inspired Version of the Bible;
Chapter 1 of the Book of Moses is accepted as section 22 of Community of Christ's Doctrine and Covenants;
In addition to appearing in the Inspired Version of the Bible, chapter 7 of the Book of Moses is accepted as section 36 of Community of Christ's Doctrine and Covenants; and
Joseph Smith–Matthew is accepted as part of the Book of Matthew in the Inspired Version of the Bible.As presently published by the LDS Church, the Pearl of Great Price also includes the Book of Abraham, Joseph Smith–History, and the Articles of Faith; these are not accepted as scripture by Community of Christ.
