Reuben Clark of the First Presidency in favour of the KJV and the Greek Textus Receptus, and in opposition to the RV, ASV and RSV and the Greek Westcottâ€“Hort text (using the KJV basis of the Inspired Version as one of the arguments in favour of the KJV), the KJV has been firmly established as the approved English-language bible of the LDS Church, cemented upon the LDS Church publishing its own edition of the KJV in 1979.
