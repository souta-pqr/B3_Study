LDS Church temples are open only to approved members and are primarily used for the performance of rites such as the endowment, celestial marriage, and baptism for the dead; these ordinances have never been embraced by Community of Christ.Historically, Community of Christ did include documents in its Doctrine and Covenants which sanctioned baptism for the dead and other temple rites.
