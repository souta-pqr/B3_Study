As such, the commandment to construct the present Independence Temple is included in section 149 of the Community of Christ edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, and further instructions regarding its construction and purpose are included in later sections.Community of Christ does not practice and has traditionally objected to the idea of sacraments or rituals being performed in its temples; half of the eight sacraments (baptism, confirmation, blessing of children, marriage) are not performed in Community of Christ temples (although, for example, the Lord's Supper and anointing of the sick are), and neither has a baptismal font.
