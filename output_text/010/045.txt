The show followed thirteen would-be musical artists hit the road with Elliott in a competition to be signed to The Goldmind, Inc. Jessica Betts eventually won the competition and walked away with $100,000 and a chance to cut a single for The Goldmind Inc. She recorded her debut album, Jessie Pearl, and was at first to include various collaborations from the likes of Elliott, Timbaland, Faith Evans and labelmate, Tweet; the result was two Elliott and Souldiggaz contributions and a delayed release in Japan.
