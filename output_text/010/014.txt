Similarities to I²C include:

Low-speed serial bus
Open-collector with passive pull-up
Speed limited by distributed capacitance
Receiver can convert a transmitted 1 bit to a 0
Multiple masters allowed via arbitration: sending a 1 bit and observing a 0 indicates loss
Byte-oriented protocol
Each byte has an acknowledge bit appended
Special start signalDifferences from I²C:

Single wire rather than two wires
Bits sent with fixed timing rather than separate clock
1000× lower speed (417 bit/s instead of 400 kbit/s)
Four address bits rather than seven
Defined protocol for dynamic address allocation
Header includes both initiator and recipient address
No special stop signal; instead, each byte has an end of message flag appended
No "read" operations; all data bytes in a frame are sent from transmitter
Instead, "get" requests solicit response frames
Every device must be able to transmit
Detailed specification of meaning of bytes after the addressEach bit begins with the line pulled low (falling edge), a delay indicating the bit value, a rising edge, and further delay until the start of the following bit.
