So far, there have been five such popes:

Pope Timothy Joseph Blasio Atila (1963–1998)
Pope Maria Pius Lawrence Jairo Chiaji K'Adera (1998–2004)
Pope Raphael Titus Otieno (2004–present)
By 2009, there were differences in Legio Maria that led to the consecration of a Cardinal Romanus Alphonse Ong'ombe, going against the order of succession placed by Simeo Ondetto and enforced by Our Lady.
