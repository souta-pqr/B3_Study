In a comparative analysis of three works from Levitan's "dramatic cycle" of the first half of the 1890s, the art historian Vladimir Petrov wrote that if in the first painting of the trilogy - By The Pool - "the expression of the artist's experiences and understanding of the dissonances and contradictions of existence had a deeply personal, almost irrational character," in the second painting - Vladimirka - the "socio-historical 'dimension' of the pictures" predominates, then in the third and final painting - Over Eternal Peace - "Levitan's dramatic 'thinking in pictures' takes on an almost natural-philosophical, planetary scale in its essence."
