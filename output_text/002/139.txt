According to him, at the time when Levitan was working in the Udomlya Lake area, the only wooden church on the lake shore was "between the villages of Akulovo and Troitsa, towards Lubenkino," and in the early 1900s it was "dismantled and moved to the other side of the lake, to the village of Ryad," where it burned down some time later.
