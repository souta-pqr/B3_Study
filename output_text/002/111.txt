Fedorov-Davydov noted that in the painting we see "a clear construction of the image from the main parts and different detailing of each of them"; all this corresponds to the compositional solution of the canvas, in which "asymmetry is balanced by the antidirectional movement of each of these parts that make up the painting - the cape, the islet, the water, the clouds, etc."
