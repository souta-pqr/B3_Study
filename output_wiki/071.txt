The Football Cup of Greater Greece (Greek: Κύπελλο Μεγάλης Ελλάδος) (officially the Cup of Friendship between Mother Greece and Daughter Cyprus (Greek: Κύπελλο Φιλίας Μητρός Ελλάδος και Θυγατρός Κύπρου)) was a two match competition held usually during the Easter period and contested by previous season's winners of the Cypriot Cup and the Greek Cup. It was held between 1969 and 1976.

Also, from 1967 until 1974, the Cypriot Champions were promoted to the Greek First National Division and, in case of relegation, they were replaced by the Cypriot Champions of the next season. Cypriot teams were relegated every season from the Alpha Ethniki, apart from 1974, when APOEL managed to remain in the Greek Championship. However, due to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus that year, APOEL withdrew from the League.
