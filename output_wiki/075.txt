Fear of the Digital Remix is the third studio album by industrial band Deitiphobia, released in January 1995 by Myx Records. All the songs on the album were created by Michael Knott using samples from two earlier Deitiphobia albums, Fear of God and Digital Priests - the Remixes, which he digitally edited to produce songs that barely resembled the originals they were taken from.
