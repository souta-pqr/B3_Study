Joshua Andre interprets the song as "tug(ging) at the human soul, and encourag(ing) us to act like the very opposite of what the song is saying."
Deena Jakoub of Veridia says, "I realized that in taking action to numb painful emotions, I was also numbing beautiful ones. While trying to numb heartbreak, I was simultaneously numbing my ability to feel the love around me.... I've decided to stop letting fear, anxiety, and depression prevent me from having incredible experiences, from loving and truly knowing myself and others."
