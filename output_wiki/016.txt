== Four Resources Model ==
In the early 1990s, Luke and Peter Freebody introduced the Four Resources Model in literacy education. This model seeks to reconcile the debates between whole language, phonics, critical literacy and others. This model postulates that in order to be a fully literate citizen, a person needs:

coding competence (the ability to decode text, i.e. phonics)
semantic competence (the ability to make meaning, i.e. comprehension)
pragmatic competence (every day, functional literacy, i.e. writing a check, reading the newspaper, filling out a job application, etc.)
critical competence (the ability to critically select and analyze texts, i.e. avoiding scams, determining reliable sources of information, etc.)Luke and Freebody assert that no one of these resources is sufficient by itself but that each is essential. Further, the resources are not meant to indicate a sequence of instruction. Different resources should be present in instruction in varying amounts, depending upon the needs of the students. Luke has also stated that critical competence, far from being an advanced area of study, can begin to be developed in year one of education and before.


== Personal history ==
Allan Luke is a third-generation Chinese-American by birth. He is an Australian and Canadian dual citizen. He grew up in Los Angeles and attended school in Echo Park and Silverlake. In 1973, he moved to Canada to attend Simon Fraser University. His partner Carmen Luke published major work on feminism, sociology and media literacy. Luke worked as a substitute teacher in the schools of the Fraser Valley. He studied primary education with Kieran Egan. In 1975, Jonathan Kozol, who had just published The Night is Dark and I am Far From Home, came to SFU as a guest lecturer. He introduced Luke to the works of Paulo Freire, including Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Luke describes this as a life-changing event.Luke initially had difficulty finding a job as a primary teacher, which he believes was due to prejudice against Asian people still prevalent in Canada at the time. In Armstrong, British Columbia, he was hired at a rural secondary school teaching English, drama, and Spanish. When the first wave of Vietnamese immigrants arrived in Canada in 1976, he was asked to teach ESL, although he had no training or background in ESL at the time.
Luke worked toward his Ph.D. in Sociology of Literacy, an emergent area of research. At the time, literacy was thought to be a cognitive and psycholinguistic process that had little to do with social factors, including class, race, and identity.  He was supervised by Suzanne DeCastell, a Canadian philosopher of education. As he reached the end of his Ph.D., he received a job offer from James Cook University in Australia. He moved there in 1984 and became the first non-white professor on faculty. Luke taught reading/language arts methods and was assigned to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander teacher education program. Luke taught and worked with an important generation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander teachers, researchers and educational leaders. In 2013, he chaired and co-authored the most extensive empirical study of Australian Indigenous school reform to date, leading to a comprehensive research report to the federal government.
