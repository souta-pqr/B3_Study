Parkenfestivalen is an outdoors festival that takes place in Bodø, Norway every year in August. This has been a tradition ever since 2006, and the festival only gets bigger every year. The festival is held in a park called Rensåsparken. In the beginning the people organizing the festival only expected about 2500 paying visitors, but already the first year many more came. This year it was sold out about 8 months before it took place. The target group for the festival is mainly young adults and adults.
