== Production ==
Just Heroes began production as a benefit for the Hong Kong Director's Union. The film was made to aid director Chang Cheh, who was broke. When actors Danny Lee and David Chiang found out about Chang's financial situation, they developed the story Just Heroes, which was made to be similar to the film A Better Tomorrow. John Woo directed about 60% of the film.


== Release ==
Just Heroes was released on 14 September 1989. The film was not a major financial success in Hong Kong, making HK$7,913,229 and coming in 48th place in the year end box office. All the money from the film was given to Chang Cheh so he could retire. Rather than using it as retirement funds, Chang used the money to direct another film.
