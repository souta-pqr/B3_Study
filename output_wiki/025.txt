Herbes de Provence (French: [ɛʁb də pʁɔvɑ̃s]; Provençal: èrbas de Provença, [ˈɛr.bas də pɾoˈvɛn.sa]) is a mixture of dried herbs considered typical of the Provence region of southeastern France. Formerly simply a descriptive term, commercial blends started to be sold under this name in the 1970s. These blends often contain savory, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and more. Lavender leaves or buds are also sometimes included in North American formulations. The herb mixture is typically used with grilled foods, stews, and soups.


== History ==

Provençal cuisine uses many herbs which are often characterized collectively as herbes de Provence, but not in specific combinations, and not sold as a mixture. It was in the 1970s that homogenised mixtures were formulated by spice wholesalers, including Ducros in France, which is now part of McCormick & Company.: 138 


== Origin ==
The commercial name herbes de Provence has no Protected Geographical Status or other legal definition. Indeed, only 10% of herbes de Provence sold in France are produced in France; 95% come from Central European (especially Poland) and Eastern European (notably Albania) countries, the Maghreb, or China. Herbes de Provence are often sold in larger bags than other herbs, and the price in Provence is considerably lower than for other herbs.


== Herbs used ==
These mixtures typically contain savory, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and other herbs. In the North American market, lavender leaves are also typically included, though lavender does not appear in the recipes in Jean-Baptiste Reboul's 1910 compendium of Provençal cooking. The Label Rouge definition is 19% thyme, 27% rosemary, 27% savory, and 27% oregano. 
They may also contain other herbs such as basil, bay leaf, hyssop, tarragon, summer savory, parsley, fennel, and chervil.


== Uses ==
Herbes de Provence are used to flavour grilled foods such as fish and meat, and vegetable stews. The mixture can be added to foods before, during, or after cooking, or mixed with cooking oil before cooking. They can also be sprinkled on raw foods such as vinaigrettes, salads or fresh cheese.
