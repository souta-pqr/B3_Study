Jadagu played in Pitchfork Music Festival London 2022.
In 2023, Jadagu announced her debut album, Aperture, alongside the single "What You Did." Aperture was written between her tours with Faye Webster, Wet, and Frankie Cosmos, and is themed around "about the transitional experience of coming into [Jadagu's] early 20s." The title is inspired by aperture priority in photography; as explained by Jadagu, "as a young person today, you have to know how to choose what to carry with you from your experiences and what to leave behind, what to close the light on."
New York Times described "What You Did" as showcasing "Jadaguâ€™s easy aptitude with lilting melodies and her love of deliciously crunchy texture."
