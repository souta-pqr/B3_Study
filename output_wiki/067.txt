== History ==
On 4 January 1904, a town plebiscite was conducted to determine whether residents supported a publicly financed library and reading room. The vote was 90–26 in favour of using tax revenues to fund the library, with support in each of the three wards (36–5 in St. George's Ward, 36–10 in St. Andrew's Ward, and 18–11 in St. Patrick's Ward).


== Collections ==
In 2009, the library established a video games collection. It also digitized the Bowman art collection, comprising paintings, sculptures and other artworks, and made it accessible on its website in 2010. The website also provides access to lithograph prints of the Frederick Hagan Collection and various community collections.


== Services ==
The library grants a free membership card to any individual that resides, works, or is a student in Newmarket or any of the other municipalities of York Region, that is Aurora, East Gwillimbury, Georgina, King, Markham, Richmond Hill, Vaughan, and Whitchurch–Stouffville.
The library offers room rentals, access to numerous databases, genealogy and town history research tools, and exam proctoring for "any person enrolled in an academic institution that requires students to complete examinations under the supervision of an approved proctor". It operates The Era, a digitization program to digitally preserve the town's newspaper.
Programs for children, youth, and adults are offered seasonally. The library participates in the student-operated volunteer Chess in the Library program.
It also allows patrons to return loaned material at a dropbox at Upper Canada Mall, which is accessible when the mall is open.
