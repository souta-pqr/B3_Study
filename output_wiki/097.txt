The 1987 West Coast Athletic Conference men's basketball tournament (now West Coast Conference) was held from February 28 to March 7, with the semifinals and finals at the War Memorial Gymnasium at the University of San Francisco in San Francisco, California. This was the first edition of the conference tournament and included all eight teams.
The first round quarterfinals were held on the home courts of the top four seeds, and two of the hosts were defeated. In the semifinals on a neutral court in San Francisco, the lower seeds won both semifinals; both had losing conference records.
Fifth-seeded Santa Clara defeated #7 Pepperdine in the championship game 77â€“65 to gain the automatic bid to the 64-team NCAA tournament, and were seeded fifteenth in the West regional. Regular season champion San Diego, upset by a point in the conference semifinals, received an at-large bid and were the ninth seed in the Midwest regional; both WCAC teams lost in the first round.
