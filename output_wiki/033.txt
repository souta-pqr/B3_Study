=== Teams details ===


== Regular season ==
The regular season began on October 22, 2007.
The first phase was a regular season, in which the competing teams were drawn into three groups, each containing eight teams. Each team played every other team in its group at home and away, resulting in 14 games for each team in the first stage. The top 5 teams in each group and the best sixth-placed team advanced to the next round. The complete list of tiebreakers was provided in the lead-in to the Regular Season results.
If one or more clubs were level on won-lost record, tiebreakers are applied in the following order:

Head-to-head record in matches between the tied clubs
Overall point difference in games between the tied clubs
Overall point difference in all group matches (first tiebreaker if tied clubs were not in the same group)
Points scored in all group matches
Sum of quotients of points scored and points allowed in each group match

== Top 16 ==
The surviving teams were divided into four groups of four teams each, and again a round robin system was adopted, resulting in 6 games each, with the two top teams advancing to the quarterfinals. Tiebreakers were identical to those used in the Regular Season.
The draw to set up the Top 16 groups was held on Monday, February 4, 2008 (the week after the end of the Regular Season), in Madrid.The teams were placed into four pools, as follows:
Level 1: The three group winners, plus the top-ranked second-place team

CSKA Moscow, Panathinaikos, Lietuvos Rytas, Real MadridLevel 2: The remaining second-place teams, plus the top two third-place teams

Maccabi Elite, Montepaschi Siena, Unicaja Málaga, Tau CerámicaLevel 3: The remaining third-place team, plus the three fourth-place teams

FC Barcelona, Efes Pilsen, Žalgiris, Fenerbahçe ÜlkerLevel 4: The fifth-place teams, plus the top ranked sixth-place team

Olympiacos, Aris, Partizan, Lottomatica RomaEach Top 16 group included one team from each pool. The draw was conducted under the following restrictions:

No more than two teams from the same Regular Season group could be placed in the same Top 16 group.
No more than two teams from the same country could be placed in the same Top 16 group.
If there is a conflict between these two restrictions, (1) would receive priority.Another draw was held to determine the order of fixtures. In the cases of two teams from the same city in the Top 16 (Panathinaikos and Olympiacos, Efes Pilsen and Fenerbahçe), they were scheduled so that only one of the two teams would be at home in a given week.


== Quarterfinals ==

Each quarterfinal was a best-of-three (if third serie necessary) series between a first-place team in the Top 16 and a second-place team from a different group, with the first-place team receiving home advantage. All opening games were played on April 1, 2008, and all second games were played on April 3. The deciding third games were played on April 9 and April 10.


== Final four ==

The Final Four is the last phase of each Euroleague season, and is held over a weekend. The semifinal games are played on Friday evening. Sunday starts with the third-place game, followed by the championship final.
