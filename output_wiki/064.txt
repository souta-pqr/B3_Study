Middle Yanggao Road (simplified Chinese: 杨高中路; traditional Chinese: 楊高中路; pinyin: Yánggāo Zhōnglù) is a station on Line 9 of the Shanghai Metro. It is located at the intersection of Middle Yanggao Road and Minsheng Road in the city's Pudong New Area. It served as the eastern terminus of the line from its opening on 7 April 2010, until 30 December 2017, when an eastern extension of Line 9 opened, extending the line further east to Caolu.The station was conceived as part of phase two of Line 9. However, due to construction delays, it opened on 7 April 2010, three months later than the other stations on the same easterly extension. On 30 December 2021 the station became an interchange after the opening of Line 18.
