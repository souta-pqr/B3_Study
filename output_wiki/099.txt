Clear Tamei is an extended play (EP) by producer Seamus Malliagh, known by his stage name Iglooghost, released on the Brainfeeder label on 8 August 2018. It is the first of two EPs released by Malliagh, the second being Steel Mogu.
The EP, especially the title track, notably contains lyrics rapped and chanted in an as-yet-unnamed constructed language developed by Malliagh, described by Jay Balfour writing for Pitchfork as "mumbled gibberish".
