The Monmouth Oaks is an American Thoroughbred horse race held annually at Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport, New Jersey for three-year-old fillies. Named for England's Epsom Oaks, first run in 1779, the inaugural American edition took place in 1871. Originally raced over a distance of 1+1⁄2 miles from 1871 through 1877, there was no race in 1878 but on its return the following year was modified to 1+1⁄4 miles.
In 1891, the New Jersey Legislature began a move to ban parimutuel betting and the Oaks had to be moved to the Jerome Park Racetrack in The Bronx, New York. With a legislated permanent ban, after the 1893 running the Monmouth Park Racetrack was shut down and the property sold. In 1946, Thoroughbred racing returned to a new Monmouth Park racing facility. The revived Monmouth Oaks was set at 1 1/16 miles.
