== Incidents and accidents ==
On August 24, 2014, at about 11:30 AM, a man trying out a newly bought experimental plane was spotted erratically taxiing down runway 6. After taking off, the pilot flew around the airport for about five minutes before going in to land. The approach was noted to be too steep and too fast. The plane eventually reached a "good speed" 1,000 feet down the runway and leveled off before descending further at a high angle. The plane bounced and then exited the runway, stopping in some shrubbery. The pilot, despite being told not to, got the airplane back on the runway and did a 180 to align with the runway. The pilot applied full throttle and the plane abruptly turned right, veering off the runway. The airplane continued going perpendicular to the runway. It was angled at a very high attack rate and rolled to the right. The plane crashed into trees 100 yards South of the departure runway. The cause was determined to be pilot error. The pilot was killed in the crash.
On January 19, 2015, a student pilot attempting a solo landing in a Cessna 172 Skyhawk clipped pine trees short of the runway. The aircraft crashed on the driveway of a private residence, coming extremely close to the house. The pilot was able to get out of the plane and go to the house for help, where he was sent to the hospital. The student pilot made a full recovery.
