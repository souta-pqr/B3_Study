The classification of candidates and changes are based on the classification of candidates at the time. For example, in the 2018 by-election for French Guiana's 2nd constituency, Davy Rimane was classified as a regionalist candidate in 2017 and a candidate of La France Insoumise in 2018 (and a comparison therefore made with 2017 candidate Paul Persdam); in addition, Ramlati Ali was classified as a Socialist Party candidate in 2017 and miscellaneous left in 2018.
